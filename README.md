## Title: Cellular Automata and Computational Universality

## Abstract
Cellular automata are discrete models with the ability to not only give rise to
beautiful, intricate patterns, but also to be used as powerful tools of
computation, with applications in cryptography, error-correction coding, and
simulation of computer processors, to name a few. They also raise profound
questions about the nature of our reality, asking whether our universe could be
one such automaton. This paper provides a discussion into these automata,
exploring the various power and limitations of a number of specific rule sets,
covering John Conway's well-known ``Game of Life'' to the more obscure
``Langton's ant'' and ``Wireworld''. In particular, it explores the notion of
computational universality, or Turing completeness, an automaton's ability to
simulate any conceivable computation, and considers their potential in the
context of solving two specific problems, the Firing Squad Synchronization
Problem and the Majority Problem. Existing solutions to these problems are
explored, and their existing avenues for optimization are discussed. In order to
fully appreciate the complex structures that can arise from such simple
beginnings, this project also presents software to visualize and probe further
into the nature of the automata highlighted.
